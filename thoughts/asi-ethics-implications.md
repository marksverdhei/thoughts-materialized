## Objective morality and its implication on superintelligence  

Artificial intelligence, philosophy  

---

Artificial Superintelligence, or ASI for short, is a term that as seen an increased freqeuncy in the distribution of modern natural language.  
It is an important word because it efficiently describes a superintelligence created by human. But I dislike the artificial adjective attached to it.  

Discussion of superintelligence (SI) is not relevant in regards to any other topic than that of human-made machine intelligence because 
we have seen no sign of terrestrial or extraterrestrial superintelligence. So I believe it is most productive to just describe artificial superintelligence as 
superintelligence with the underlying assumption that it is human-made in some degree. 

Superintelligence is superintelligence. If it is man-made, superintelligence is still as real as intelligence itself is. 
Artificial is often seen as a contradiction to real, so i will refrain from referring to the superintelligence as ASI, but rather SI.  

Ethics or morality is in its simplest sense a step to achieve mutualism in the optimiziation space of life. 
Humans are uniquely collaborative compared to other animals, which is part of the reason why we all have some concept of 
ethics and why we got a step ahead. 



If there is objective morality, SI will find it and apply it. 

Good is good, bad is bad: tautologies.
Good is bad, bad is good: contradictions.
