Trigger warning: rape, murder, and cannibalism

### The issue with polar bears  

I'll ask you the following question:  

Is any being that is pre-programmed to brutally murder and eat children of its own species good for the world?  

Well, adult male polar bears can't help it. Maybe you have seen the animal documentary episode that I have,
where a female polar bear with her cubs have to escape an unknown male polar bear to avoid having her cubs mauled to death and being raped by the murderer of her own children. I, for one, am very happy I did not witness such an abomination of action. Now, we have two words that euphemistically describe this process: Infanticide and mating, or sexually selected infanticide (SSI) when in conjunction. Perhaps a definition question but I believe it might be humanity's moral obligation to prevent the existence of such beings.

In order for my argument to hold, I first need to present evidence, or at the very least justify my claim that
adult male polar bears are conditioned to behave in this way.  

[In a 2022 scientific paper (in the peer-rewieved journal _Ursus_) on cannibalism in bears, titled: "Cannibalism in bears"](https://bioone.org/journals/ursus/volume-2022/issue-33e10/URSUS-D-20-00031.2/Cannibalism-in-bears/10.2192/URSUS-D-20-00031.2.short), found evidence of cannibalism in 4 out of 8 studied bear species. 
In this study, polar bears had more instances of cannibalism than all the other polar bear species combined.  
The main cause was infanticide (33%) and conspecific strife (15%).  

There's more scientific eveidence than this paper alone if you look further. However, I think this is the simplest way to communicate that this behavior is scientifically evident in the polar bear species.  

### Counter-arguments  



#### Symbiotic and ecological role of polar bears  

We have learned from history that attempting to exterminate a species can have unforeseen and unintended consequences.

#### Biodiversity and cosmetic arguments  

"If you kill a cockroach, you're a hero. If you kill a butterfly, you're a villain. Morals have aesthetic criteria."

#### Why don't we hold humans to the same standards?  

We do. At least, a lot of us do. Most people in the world live in a country with death penalty. 
If you don't believe me: China, India, United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Brazil cumulatively make up more than half of the world 
and they all have death penalty (Brazil has death penalty under exceptional circumstances, so I still counted it).  
But humans can be reasoned with, and taught how and why they should avoid and prevent such behaviors.
Furthermore, we create systems for humans (e.g. legal systems) where people who act in pure self interest still have less incentives for such behavior.

#### The strongest counter-argument  

Research suggests that resource scarcity for polar bears increase cannibalistic infanticide behavior.
This is a very strong argument to mitigate the effects of climate change that uniquely affect polar bears.  
However, the current research suggests (citation needed) that the primary driver is SSI, which
is not directly dependent on the resoruce scarcity caused by climate change. 


### Possible idealized solutions  

#### Retetion of species through biological records  

To throw away the history of any species existing would be an insult to the world we live in, and the entropy of the universe that is life.  
Therefore, it is important that if we, in the current day, or in the future 

#### Retention of species through human-supervision  

#### Artifical selection / genetic mutation   

### Conclusion  

I do not consider myself a utilitarian, but I truly believe utilitarian principles are integral to make the best world we can, which is our responsibility as humans.  

There are many other animals that commit infanticide among other abominations. Exhaustively evaluating these animals would be a waste of time and resources, but the principles communicated in this article should be considered
and applied to the remainder of our fauna.
