## Polar bears are monsters that we should allow to go extinct  

Trigger warning: rape, murder, and cannibalism

### My biggest issue with polar bears  

I'll ask you the following question:  

Is any being that is pre-programmed to brutally murder and eat children of its own species good for the world?  

Well, adult male polar bears can't help it. Maybe you have seen the natural geographic channel episode that I have,
where a female polar bear with her cubs have to escape an unknown male polar bear to avoid having her cubs mauled to death
and being raped by the murderer of her own children. Now, we have two words that euphemistically describe this process: Infanticide and .
Perhaps a definition question but I believe it might be humanity's moral obligation to prevent the existence of such beings.

In order for my argument to hold, I first need to present evidence, or at the very least justify my claim that
adult male polar bears are conditioned to behave in this way.  

(In a 2022 scientific paper (in the peer-rewieved journal _Ursus_) on cannibalism in bears, titled: "Cannibalism in bears")[https://bioone.org/journals/ursus/volume-2022/issue-33e10/URSUS-D-20-00031.2/Cannibalism-in-bears/10.2192/URSUS-D-20-00031.2.short], found that there was evidence of cannibalism in 4 out of 8 bear studied bear species. 
In this study, polar bears had more instances of cannibalism than all the other polar bear species combined.  
Most of these instances were instances of infanticide.  

There's more scientific eveidence than this paper alone if you look further. However, I think this is the simplest way to communicate that this behavior is
scientifically evident in the polar bear species.  

### Counter-arguments  

### Possible idealized solutions

#### Retetion of species through biological records and human-supervised captivity

### Conclusion

"If you kill a cockroach, you're a hero. If you kill a butterfly, you're a villain. Morals have aesthetic criteria."
