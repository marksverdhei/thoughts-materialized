# The absolute idiocy of 'green programming languages'  

Man-made climate change and its damages to humanity are overwhelmingly evident, and we should do what we can to mitigate it.
As the provoking title suggests, the following text will describe how the notion of 'green programming languages' is a nuisance that does more harm than good.

Measuring the energy efficiency of programming languages is useful. 
It quantifies the price of, what is often, the commodity of ease.
For instance, most developers who are equally proficient in Python and C will favor Python
when trying to solve a simple programming task quickly.

I once came across a post on social media referencing this table:

![Table of languages and energy consumption, ranked from lowest to highest.](../images/language_energy_table.jpg)

This is an interesting table with useful information. It describes the multiple of energy a program uses when compared to the same program written in C. OP's interpretation of this post
was that the table was a ranking of the extent to which a programming language is green. 

### What does it meen to assign greenness to a programming language?  

Generally speaking, Green technlogy means technology that contributes either significantly less, none at all, or negatively to harming the environment, where 'environment' mainly concerns climate and fauna. Solar-, wind-, hydro-, and nuclear energy are examples of green technology because they all satisfy this requirement, whereas fossil fuel energy is not. Now, how does this apply to programming? Programs run on computers, computers run on electricity, and electricity is generated most often from fossil fuel (source). Therefore, the amount of energy that a program requires affects how much more CO2 will be released into the atmosphere (in theory). This means that for a language to be "greener" than another, it needs to contribute to less CO2e emmision. Programs are however, also in

```
greenness(language) =  (CO2e_prevented(language) -CO2e(language)) / n_programs(language)
```


A program can consume more energy because of the time it takes for your laptop (idle) to be on when you're writing it.

**Disclaimer:** It migiht be that other people have written on this matter and made similar points that i have made in this text.
