# Welcome to my mind  

_Thoughts, materialized_ is the name of my personal collection of 
texts describing concepts i've been pondering and opinions i've made.


**Disclaimer:** It migiht be that other people have written on any matter i write about and made similar points that i have made in one of my texts. Unless referenced, i assert that the point, reasoning, or information comes from myself, and that I might happen to independently think something that someone else has thought. Plagiarism gains me nothing.
